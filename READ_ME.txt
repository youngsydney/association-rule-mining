COSC 285: Introduction to Data Mining
Project 2: Association Rule Mining

Required Libraries:
  - time
  - tqdm
  - os
  - tabulate
  - itertools

How to Run:
	Navigate to the project directory and type "python run.py" to compile and run
  the program. It takes approximately 3-4 seconds to run.

  If you would like to see the affect of adding a combination with a minimum
  support of 0.1, set the ADDITIONAL flag in config.py to True. If this is
  set to True the program will take approximately 25 seconds to run.

  The program will print out two reports as well as writing the reports to the
  file 'results.txt'. It is recommended to have your terminal in full screen in
  order to fully appreciate the output.

How to Modify:
  Updates to minimum support, minimum confidence, or adding combinations can be
  made in the config.py file.
